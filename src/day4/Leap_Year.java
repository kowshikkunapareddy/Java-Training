public class Leap_Year {

// Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year or not.
//
//Problem Statement:
//A year is considered a leap year if:
//
//It is divisible by 4.
//However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
//Use this information to create a program that:
//
//Asks the user to enter a year.
//Checks if the year is a leap year based on the conditions above.
//Prints "It's a leap year" if the year meets the leap year conditions.
//Prints "It's not a leap year" if it does not.
//Example Input and Output:
//Input: 2000
//Output: It's a leap year
//
//Input: 1900
//Output: It's not a leap year
//
//Input: 2024
//Output: It's a leap year
